# libFetLife - README

`libFetLife` is a PHP class implementing a simple API useful for interfacing with the amateur porn and fetish dating website [FetLife.com](https://fetlife.com/). Learn more [about the political motivation for this library](https://web.archive.org/web/20150912020717/https://bandanablog.wordpress.com/2015/04/30/fetlifes-best-customers/).

## System requirements

To run `libFetLife`, you need PHP version 5.3.6 or greater (with [PHP's cURL extension](https://php.net/manual/book.curl.php) installed).

## Getting started

To use `libFetLife`, include it in your project and instantiate a new `FetLifeUser` object:

```php
// Load FetLife API.
require_once 'libFetLife/FetLife.php';

// Make a FetLifeUser (like a database handle).
$FL = new FetLifeUser('username', 'password');
```

You can optionally instruct `libFetLife` to use a proxy instead of making direction connections to FetLife.com:

```php
$FL->connection->setProxy('example.proxy.com:9050', CURLPROXY_SOCKS5); // Optional.
$FL->connection->setProxy('auto'); // or, set a new randomized proxy automatically.
```

When you're ready, login with the `FetLifeUser::logIn()` method:

```php
$FL->logIn();
```

Now `$FL` represents you on FetLife:

```php
// Print some basic information about the account you're using.
print $FL->id;       // your user's numeric ID.
print $FL->nickname; // your user's nickname, the name you signed in with
//etc.
```

You use the `FetLifeUser` object's various public methods to send queries to FetLife. Replies depend on the query method:

```php
// Query FetLife for information about other users.
print $FL->getUserIdByNickname('JohnBaku'); // prints "1"
print $FL->getUserNicknameById(1254);       // prints "maymay"
```

Other FetLife users are represented as FetLifeProfile objects:

```php
// Object-oriented access to user info is available as FetLifeProfile objects.
$profile = $FL->getUserProfile(1);          // Profile with ID 1
$profile->nickname;                         // "JohnBaku"
$profile->age;
$profile->gender;
$profile->role;

// the `adr` member is an array keyed like its eponymous microformat:
$profile->adr['locality'];     // "Vancouver"
$profile->adr['region'];       // "British Columbia"
$profile->adr['country-name']; // "Canada"

// Some FetLifeProfile methods:
$profile->getAvatarURL();     // optional $size parameter retrieves larger images
$profile->isPayingAccount();  // true if the profile has a "supporter" badge
$profile->getEvents();        // array of FetLifeEvent objects listed on the profile
$profile->getEventsGoingTo(); // array of FetLifeEvent the user has RSVP'ed "going" to
$profile->getGroups();        // array of FetLifeGroup objects listed on the profile
$profile->getGroupsLead();    // array of FetLifeGroups the user moderates
```

Many methods return arrays of `FetLifeProfile` objects. Since queries are live, they can also be passed an optional page limiter.

```php
// Get a user's friends list as an array of FetLifeProfile objects.
$friends = $FL->getFriendsOf('maymay');
// A numeric FetLife user ID also works.
$friends = $FL->getFriendsOf(1254);
// If there are many pages, you can set a limit.
$friends_partial = $FL->getFriendsOf('maymay', 3); // Only first 3 pages.

// Numerous other functions also return arrays, with optional page limit.
$members = $FL->getMembersOfGroup(11708); // "Kink On Tap"
$kinksters = $FL->getKinkstersWithFetish(193); // "Corsets"
$local_kinksters = $FL->getKinkstersInLocation('cities/5898'); // all kinksters in Balitmore, MD.
$attendees = $FL->getKinkstersGoingToEvent(149379);
$maybes = $FL->getKinkstersMaybeGoingToEvent(149379, 2); // Only 2 pages.
```

Most data objects, including `FetLifeProfile`, `FetLifeWriting`, and `FetLifePicture` are descended from a common `FetLifeContent` base class. Such descendants  have a `populate()` method that fetches supplemental information about the object from FetLife:

```php
// You can also fetch arrays of a user's FetLife data as objects this way.
$writings = $FL->getWritingsOf('JohnBaku'); // All of JohnBaku's Writings.
$pictures = $FL->getPicturesOf(1);          // All of JohnBaku's Pictures.

// If you want to fetch comments, you need to populate() the objects.
$writings_and_pictures = array_merge($writings, $pictures);
foreach ($writings_and_pictures as $item) {
    $item->comments;   // currently, returns an NULL
    $item->populate();
    $item->comments;   // now, returns an array of FetLifeComment objects.
}
```

FetLife events can be queried much like profiles:

```php
// If you already know the event ID, you can just fetch that event.
$event = $FL->getEventById(151424);
// "Populate" behavior works the same way.
$event = $FL->getEventById(151424, true); // Get all availble event data.

// You can also fetch arrays of events as FetLifeEvent objects.
$events = $FL->getUpcomingEventsInLocation('cities/5898'); // Get all events in Balitmore, MD.
// Or get just the first couple pages.
$events_partial = $FL->getUpcomingEventsInLocation('cities/5898', 2); // Only 2 pages.

// FetLifeEvent objects are instantiated from minimal data.
// To fill them out, call their populate() method.
$events[0]->populate(); // Flesh out data from first event fetched.
// RSVP lists take a while to fetch, but you can get them, too.
$events[1]->populate(2); // Fetch first 2 pages of RSVP responses.
$events[2]->populate(true); // Or fetch all pages of RSVP responses.

// Now we have access to some basic event data.
print $events[2]->getPermalink();
print $events[2]->venue_name;
print $events[2]->dress_code;
// etc...

// Attendee lists are arrays of FetLifeProfile objects, same as friends lists.
// You can collect a list of all participants
$everyone = $events[2]->getParticipants();

// or interact with the separate RSVP lists individually
foreach ($events[2]->going as $profile) {
    print $profile->nickname; // FetLife names of people who RSVP'd "Going."
}
$i = 0;
$y = 0;
foreach ($events[2]->maybegoing as $profile) {
    if ('Switch' === $profile->role) { $i++; }
    if ('M' === $profile->gender) { $y++; }
}
print "There are $i Switches and $y male-identified people maybe going to {$events[2]->title}.";
```

You can also perform basic searches:

```php
$kinksters = $FL->searchKinksters('maymay'); // All Kinksters whose username contains the query.
$partial_kinksters = $FL->searchKinksters('maymay', 5) // only first 5 pages of above results.
```

## Testing

`libFetLife` uses [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) for unit testing. The `tests/` directory includes a `phpunit.xml.sample` file with a default configuration. To run live tests, you need to edit this file so that the global variables `fetlife_username`, `fetlife_password,` and `fetlife_proxyurl` have the values you want to use to create the test runner's `FetLifeUser` object, as described above, and then copy it to `phpunit.xml`.

    cd libFetLife/tests               # Inside the tests directory...
    vi phpunit.xml.sample             # is a sample PHPUnit configuration file. Edit it.
    cp phpunit.xml.sample phpunit.xml # Then copy it to PHPUnit's expected location.
